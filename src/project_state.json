    "Bubble app with SaaS multi-tenant privacy rules: users restricted to their agency/leads; role-based access (Admin vs Team).",
    "Core data types to implement in Bubble: User, Lead, Outreach Activity, Deal, Daily Task (plus later Service/Project for Agency OS upgrades).",
    "Outreach Activity events (Sent/Replied) should be the source of truth for analytics (reply rate, outreach counts by platform).",
    "OpenAI API integration for AI message generation, service recommendation, and proposal generation; store API key per user/agency for scalability.",
    "Workflow rules: Deal Won updates user Total Revenue; Follow-up Date triggers “due today” notifications; analytics update must be immediate/consistent.",
    "UI architecture: reusable components (cards, chart blocks, progress bars) and responsive sidebar navigation in teal/black/white theme.",

    "OTP login in Bubble requires external delivery (SMS/email) via third-party providers (e.g., Twilio/Sinch/MojoAuth); implementation depends on account email being enabled and/or an SMS plugin/API being configured.",
