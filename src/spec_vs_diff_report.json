  "summary": "REQ-38 and REQ-39 appear largely implemented via a centralized image mapping plus UI/layout/style refinements across Dashboard/Planner/Outreach, cards, AppShell, SidebarNav, and global CSS utilities. However, REQ-37 is only partially evidenced (a mapping exists) with no evidence that the 14 image files were actually added to the frontend static assets directory. The diff summary also indicates unrequested/auth-related and export-format behavior changes that fall outside the UI polish scope and non-goals.",

      "id": "REQ-37",
      "requirement": "Add all 14 uploaded image files to the frontend static assets directory so they load correctly in production builds (no broken links).",
      "reason": "The diff shows a constants mapping pointing to \"/assets/uploaded/...\" paths, but provides no evidence that the actual 14 image files were added under a static assets directory (e.g., frontend/public/assets/uploaded).",
