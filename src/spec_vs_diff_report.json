  "summary": "Diff adds global gradient-themed design tokens/utilities, starts expanding ServicesPricingPage with multiple grouped pricing sections, and extends 3D service icon mapping to include pricing-page category keys. However, the diff does not provide evidence that the full 30-offering catalog, the new 3-plan Monthly Maintenance Plans section, required CTAs per card, or the required static icon assets were fully implemented.",

      "id": "REQ-93",
      "requirement": "Render the complete pricing catalog as grouped sections with all 30 offerings, each showing name, ₹ INR price, and the exact bullet features.",
      "reason": "The pricing page content shown is truncated and only evidences a subset of offerings (e.g., a few offerings under Website Packages, WhatsApp Automation, Lead Generation Systems, and the beginning of Personal Brand Services). There is no evidence in the diff summary that all 30 offerings and their exact bullet lists were added.",

      "requirement": "Serve and render the required gradient 3D icons as static frontend assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and load them via publicAssetUrl with safe fallback behavior.",
      "reason": "The icon map references files under assets/generated via publicAssetUrl, but the diff shows no new files added (no static PNGs under frontend/public/assets/generated). Also, the diff does not show the pricing page actually rendering the icons per section/offering nor demonstrate the fallback behavior.",

      "reason": "No evidence of a \"Monthly Maintenance Plans\" section or the three required plans/prices/bullets appears in the provided (truncated) ServicesPricingPage diff.",

      "reason": "ServicesPricingPage imports Button and CheckoutDialog, but the provided diff snippet does not show any rendered “Select Plan”/“Get Started” buttons or the wiring that opens CheckoutDialog with the correct amount/name per offering/plan.",
