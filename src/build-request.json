      "text": "Add a 3D icon system for Services and Niches, and render the appropriate 3D icon consistently across the UI wherever a service or niche is shown (at minimum: Services page service cards, Service Details dialog header area, Services & Pricing page category/tier cards, and any niche labels/filters where present). Include a safe fallback icon when no specific icon exists for a given service/niche value.",

        "ServicesPricingPage shows a 3D icon for each of the 5 service categories and for Monthly Maintenance (or default).",

      "text": "Update the checkout flow so that when the Checkout dialog opens from any entry point (Services page or Services & Pricing page), the user is immediately guided/redirected to the payment options area, and after an order is created the dialog automatically brings the payment instructions (UPI/Razorpay/Stripe) into view for the selected payment method.",

  "nonGoals": [
    "Implementing real-time payment confirmation (webhooks, polling gateways, or automatic status reconciliation) is out of scope.",
    "Creating unique bespoke 3D artwork for every individual custom service record name is out of scope; icons should be mapped by service category/type/subtype and niche, with a robust default fallback."
